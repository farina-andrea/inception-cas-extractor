# INCEpTION CAS Annotation Extractor

This repository contains Python tools for extracting annotations from XMI files generated by [INCEpTION](https://inception-project.github.io/) using the UIMA CAS framework. The main goal of this tool is to help scholars extract linguistic annotations from INCEpTION's XMI files for further analysis.

## Dependencies

To run this notebook, you'll need to install the required libraries. You can easily install them using the following:

If you haven't already, install the required libraries via the `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or, alternatively, you can install the libraries individually:

```
pip install dkpro-cassis lxml
```

## Files

`extract_annotations.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook that contains the code to extract annotations from XMI files.

`typesystem.xml`: The type system XML file required to load the annotation types.

`requirements.txt`: List of Python libraries needed to run the notebook.

`LICENSE`: This repository is licensed under the MIT License.

# How to use

1.

Prepare your files: Place your XMI files (the annotated data) and `typesystem.xml` in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook.

The XMI files contain the text annotations from INCEpTION.

The `typesystem.xml` file defines the annotation types and is required for loading the annotations correctly.
